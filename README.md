# Hereâ€™s a Compensation Analytics Dashboard project using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. 

## This project will process compensation data, analyze pay structures, compare salary benchmarks, and generate insights for HR and business leaders. 


The project includes:

1. Data Cleaning & Processing
2. Benchmarking & Pay Equity Analysis
3. ompensation Trends & Distribution
4. Interactive Visualizations
5. Dashboard Generation


 I have enhanced the project by adding Netflix-specific compensation analysis, stock options handling, outlier detection using Z-score, and a dedicated visualization for Netflix compensation trends. This makes the project highly relevant to a role at Netflix and provides deeper insights into compensation structures.
